    <h1>What is Web design?</h1>
    <p>
      Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the
      internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
      development rather than software development. Web design used to be
      focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the
      mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
      ever-increasingly important. A web designer works on the appearance,
      layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for
      instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to
      how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy
      to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the
      website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no
      extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse
      users appears. As the keystone of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that
      wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many
      potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical
      consideration.
